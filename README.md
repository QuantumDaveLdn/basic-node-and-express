# freeCodeCamp Backend Development Journey

## Basic Node and Express

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "Basic Node and Express" section.

### Progress Summary (15 May 2025)

I've just started the "Basic Node and Express" section of the course. In this section, I'll be learning:

* Meet the Node console
* Start a Working Express Server
* Serve an HTML File
* Serve Static Assets
* Serve JSON on a Specific Route
* Use the .env File
* Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware
* Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server
* Get Route Parameter Input from the Client
* Get Query Parameter Input from the Client
* Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests
* Get Data from POST Requests

### Current Status ⏳

This section is in progress. I've set up the initial Express server boilerplate code and will be working through each challenge systematically.

### Next Steps

I'll be completing each challenge in the "Basic Node and Express" section before moving on to the "MongoDB and Mongoose" portion of the certification.

The complete certification path I'm following includes:

1. Managing Packages with NPM (✓ COMPLETED)
2. Basic Node and Express (⏳ IN PROGRESS)
3. MongoDB and Mongoose (UPCOMING)
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects (UPCOMING)

## Skills to Acquire

* Setting up Express servers
* Handling different types of HTTP requests
* Creating and using middleware
* Serving different types of content (HTML, JSON, static assets)
* Working with environment variables
* Parsing and processing request data

*This repository demonstrates my systematic approach to learning foundational web technologies as I build toward my ultimate goal of becoming an AI engineer. Understanding backend systems and APIs is crucial for developing and deploying robust AI applications.*
