# freeCodeCamp Backend Development Journey

## Basic Node and Express

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "Basic Node and Express" section.

### Progress Summary (16 May 2025)

I've been working through the "Basic Node and Express" section of the course. So far, I've completed:

* Meet the Node console ✓
* Start a Working Express Server ✓
* Serve an HTML File ✓
* Serve Static Assets ✓
* Serve JSON on a Specific Route ✓
* Use the .env File ✓
* Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware ✓
* Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server ✓
* Get Route Parameter Input from the Client ✓
* Get Query Parameter Input from the Client ✓
* Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests ✓
* Get Data from POST Requests ✓

In these challenges, I've learned how to:
- Set up a basic Express server
- Serve HTML files and static assets
- Create JSON endpoints
- Use environment variables with dotenv
- Implement middleware for request logging
- Chain middleware functions
- Handle route parameters (:word)
- Process query parameters
- Parse form data with body-parser
- Handle POST requests

### Current Status ✓

Completed all challenges in the "Basic Node and Express" section! I've built a simple API that can:
- Serve static files
- Respond with JSON
- Use environment variables
- Log requests
- Chain middleware
- Handle route parameters
- Process form submissions

### Next Steps

Now that I've completed the "Basic Node and Express" section, I'll move on to the "MongoDB and Mongoose" portion of the certification.

The complete certification path I'm following includes:

1. Managing Packages with NPM (✓ COMPLETED)
2. Basic Node and Express (✓ COMPLETED)
3. MongoDB and Mongoose (⏳ UPCOMING)
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects (UPCOMING)

## Skills Acquired

* Setting up Express servers
* Handling different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST)
* Creating and using middleware
* Serving different types of content (HTML, JSON, static assets)
* Working with environment variables
* Parsing and processing request data
* Working with route and query parameters
* Form data handling

*This repository demonstrates my systematic approach to learning foundational web technologies as I build toward my ultimate goal of becoming an AI engineer. Understanding backend systems and APIs is crucial for developing and deploying robust AI applications.*
