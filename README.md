# freeCodeCamp Backend Development Journey

## Basic Node and Express

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "Basic Node and Express" section.

### Progress Summary (15 May 2025)

I've been working through the "Basic Node and Express" section of the course. So far, I've completed:

* Meet the Node console ✓
* Start a Working Express Server ✓
* Serve an HTML File ✓
* Serve Static Assets ✓
* Serve JSON on a Specific Route ✓
* Use the .env File ✓
* Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware ✓

In these challenges, I've learned how to:
- Set up a basic Express server
- Serve HTML files and static assets
- Create JSON endpoints
- Use environment variables with dotenv
- Implement middleware for request logging

### Current Status ⏳

Making steady progress through this section. Next, I'll be working on:

* Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server
* Get Route Parameter Input from the Client
* Get Query Parameter Input from the Client
* Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests
* Get Data from POST Requests

### Next Steps

After completing the "Basic Node and Express" section, I'll move on to the "MongoDB and Mongoose" portion of the certification.

The complete certification path I'm following includes:

1. Managing Packages with NPM (✓ COMPLETED)
2. Basic Node and Express (⏳ IN PROGRESS)
3. MongoDB and Mongoose (UPCOMING)
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects (UPCOMING)

## Skills to Acquire

* Setting up Express servers
* Handling different types of HTTP requests
* Creating and using middleware
* Serving different types of content (HTML, JSON, static assets)
* Working with environment variables
* Parsing and processing request data

*This repository demonstrates my systematic approach to learning foundational web technologies as I build toward my ultimate goal of becoming an AI engineer. Understanding backend systems and APIs is crucial for developing and deploying robust AI applications.*
